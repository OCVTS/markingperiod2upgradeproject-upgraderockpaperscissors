                    <td><i>Rock Paper Scissors v2.0</i> is a more sophisticated<br>
                        variant of the original rock paper scissors game, now with<br>
                        a <strong>timer!</strong> You are no longer allowed to initiate<br>
                        the game via pressing one of the buttons. Your fate will<br>
                        be determined based on your reaction time. The choice<br>
                        is up to you, and you must begin by pressing<br>
                        "Start game". You are only given <strong>3 seconds</strong> to make<br>
                        a choice and if nothing is selected, you are disqualified,<br>
                        and the point will automatically go to the computer.<br>
                        <u>You will be given another chance at redemption<br>
                        every round.</u>

                    <td>This might’ve been the hardest project I’ve<br>
                        worked on in my opinion. Trying to implement<br> 
                        an object named timer was possibly the most annoying<br>
                        process of the entire project. What made it<br>
                        worse is that back then I used to have<br>
                        CSS connected to playerScore, computerScore,<br>
                        And the gameLead. I had to get rid of it<br>
                        After not being able to get them working at all.<br>
                        I believe it took me around 3 hours for the whole project,<br>
                        I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</td>
